				IMDb (Internet Movie Database) is the world’s most popular and
				authoritative source for movie, TV, and celebrity content. Launched in
				1990 as a hobby project by Col Needham, it quickly grew into a
				comprehensive resource for film enthusiasts, offering information on
				movies, television shows, actors, directors, and industry professionals.
				Over the years, IMDb has expanded its database to include millions of
				titles and credits, providing detailed plot summaries, trivia, reviews,
				ratings, and a variety of multimedia content such as trailers and
				photos.

				IMDb's user-generated content has made it a unique platform where fans
				can contribute to the site’s vast repository of information. Its rating
				system, driven by user votes, has become an influential tool in
				determining the popularity and success of films and shows. From
				blockbuster films to indie projects, IMDb’s ranking and review system
				plays a significant role in shaping public opinion. With a community of
				over 200 million monthly visitors, it also offers a platform for users
				to engage in discussions, share opinions, and connect over shared
				entertainment interests.

				In addition to being a resource for casual viewers, IMDb also caters to
				industry professionals. Through IMDbPro, an advanced version of the
				site, actors, filmmakers, and other industry members can manage their
				profiles, access exclusive data such as box office numbers, and network
				with fellow professionals. With partnerships across the entertainment
				industry and a vast user base, IMDb continues to serve as a vital hub
				for both fans and professionals in the world of film and television.
